        "atr": "ATR: Averages true range to measure volatility. Usage: Set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizes based on current market volatility. Tips: It's a reactive measure, so use it as part of a broader risk management strategy.",

Usage: Identify overbought (>80) or oversold (<20) conditions and confirm the strength of trends or reversals. Tips: Use alongside RSI or MACD to confirm signals; divergence between price and MFI can indicate potential reversals.",
